        <p class="roboto-regular about-paragraph">
            CerescoBank was established in 1911 as the Farmers and Merchants Bank of Ceresco 
            and was situated on the corner of South 2nd Street and Elm. The bank has served the 
            Ceresco Community since that time. The present bank building at 130 West Elm Street 
            was completed in 1983, allowing the bank to have a drive-thru banking lane and an 
            expanded modern customer service area. In 1990 the bank name was changed to CerescoBank 
            to reflect its identity and close ties to the Ceresco Community.
